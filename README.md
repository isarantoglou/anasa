# Ανάσα - Greek Holiday Leave Optimizer

"Πάρε ανάσα από τη δουλειά" (Take a breath from work)

## About This Project

This project is an experiment in AI-driven development. The entire codebase—from architecture decisions to implementation details—was generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) powered by Claude Opus 4.5, with minimal human intervention. The goal was to explore what modern AI assistants can accomplish when given creative freedom to build a complete, production-ready application from scratch.

No developer wrote or debugged the code manually. Instead, the human role was limited to providing high-level requirements, reviewing outputs, and guiding the AI through natural conversation. This serves as a practical case study in AI-assisted software development and its current capabilities.

A Vue 3 application by [Oxygen](https://www.oxygen.gr) that helps users maximize their vacation days by finding optimal leave periods around Greek public holidays. The UI is fully in Greek.

**[Live Demo](https://anasa.oxygen.gr/)**

## Features

### Core Optimization
- **Smart Leave Optimization** - Finds all leave periods for the year ranked by efficiency (days off / leave days used)
- **Dual Sorting** - Sort opportunities by efficiency (best value) or chronologically by date
- **Orthodox Easter Calculation** - Accurate calculation of movable holidays based on Orthodox Easter
- **Custom Holidays** - Add local holidays manually or search 130+ Greek towns for patron saint days

### Annual Planning
- **Annual Leave Plan** - Save multiple opportunities to build a complete yearly plan
- **Custom Periods** - Add your own leave periods with optional labels (e.g., "Trip to America")
- **Custom Period Badges** - Custom periods are visually distinct with "Προσαρμοσμένο" badge
- **Conflict Detection** - Warns when adding overlapping periods
- **Remaining Days Tracking** - Track used vs remaining days from your total allocation

### Export Options
- **Share as Image** - Generate PNG cards for any opportunity
- **Calendar Export** - Download your annual plan as .ics file for Google Calendar/Outlook
- **Leave Request Generator** - Generate formal Greek leave request letters

### Additional Features
- **Year Comparison** - Compare holidays across up to 3 years with weekend indicators
- **Parent Mode** - Optimize for family time during school breaks (Christmas & Easter)
- **Holy Spirit Toggle** - Include/exclude Agios Pneumatos based on your company policy
- **Dark Mode** - Full dark mode support with persistence

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** with Composition API (`<script setup>`)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Vite 7**
- **date-fns** with Greek locale
- **html2canvas** for image generation

## How It Works

The optimizer uses a sliding window algorithm to find optimal leave periods. It calculates:

1. **Orthodox Easter** using the Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithm with Julian to Gregorian conversion
2. **Fixed Holidays** - New Year, Epiphany, Independence Day, Labor Day, Assumption, Oxi Day, Christmas
3. **Movable Holidays** - Clean Monday, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Holy Spirit Monday
4. **Efficiency Ratio** - Total days off divided by leave days used
